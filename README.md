# SSL 
Security Socket Layer : Basically it is a security check for the server. Whenever a client goes to a server, it assumes that the data is encrpyted. But it is only happens when the server owns a security certificate.
So, if it has a certificate it will encrpyt data (i.e a HTTPs site) or otherwise it won't (i.e. a HTTP site).
In this code I have tried to mimic the functionality of the already existing classes in java by a simple code.
